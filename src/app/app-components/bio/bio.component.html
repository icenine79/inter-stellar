        <h3 class="mat-h2">
          My name is VÃ­tor Ferreira and I was born in 19/09/1979 in Ponte de Lima,
          currently I live in Lisbon after having my bachelor degree in Coimbra (Linguistics)

          I took a Masters degree in book publishing (FCSH de Lisboa) and after a long period working as
        freelance journalist and as a editorial assistant, I decided to have a complete turnover on my professional career.
          <br>Took a professional course on web development (mobile and web) in Flag school where I learned HTML5, CSS3,
          JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL and native mobile such as Android and IOS (Objective-C)
          After a quick internship at Ogilvy and Mather, I decided to become a Front End Developer so I learned Angular (v4)

          in Udemy online school (several courses). Since then, my professional life has been dealing with this powerfull framework
